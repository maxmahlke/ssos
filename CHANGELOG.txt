1.2.0
---
* Included the option to remove source detections within 1" of the reference catalogue sources in SCAMP before the pattern matching. This is turned on using the REMOVE_REF_SOURCES parameter. Random associations of SSOs with stars and galaxies are effectively removed this way. Note that the importance of the choice of reference catalogue increases.
* The pre-configured SExtractor and SCAMP config files were updated to the latest versions (2.25.0 and 2.7.7 respectively)
* Renamed several output parameters to better match common standards
* Code restructured, leading to major speed ups in SExtractor catalogue look-ups


1.1.10
---
* The SCAMP reference catalogue can now be used in the FILTER_STAR_REGIONS step, with an optional limit on the magnitude of the reference sources. Consequently, the FILTER_STAR_REGIONS step is renamed to FILTER_BRIGHT_SOURCES
* SSOs can exhibit constant apparent motion in declination. This scenario is now accounted for in the linear motion routine by transforming the equatorial to ecliptic coordinates and repeating the weighted linear fits in ecliptic longitude and latitude space
* Changed linear filter routine from scipy.optimize.curve_fit to statsmodels.api.WLS
* Changed the proper motion limits from exclusive to inclusive
* pipeline_settings.ssos is now default.ssos, analogous to astrOmatic software approach
