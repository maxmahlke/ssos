1.3.3 - 2023-05-16
------------------
- Increase size of SkyBot query to account for out-of-view matches
- Minor bugfixes in cutout creation

1.3.2 - 2021-12
---------------
- Don't print skybot match statistics if the reference contains a single source
- Catch comet designations in the skybot number column

1.3.1
-----
* Copying the default configuration fails if the files exist in CWD
* REFOUT_CATPATH in SCAMP can be used to put the reference catalogue into the
  cats/ directory


1.3
---
* Included MPC parser: Calling `ssos --mpc path/to/csv` on the ssos output
  creates a textfile with the observations formatted for MPC submission
* Included checkplots: Optional analysis steps, see online documentation SKYBOT_RESIDUALS,SKYBOT_PM
* Output now contains three more columns. `MATCHED`, containing a boolean value
  with True if object was matched to known SSO, else False. `SKYBOT_DELTARA` and `SKYBOT_DELTADEC`, which are the residuals of the recovered and the predicted position of each match SSO detection in arcsecond
* MAG_CI and MAG_ERR_CI are renamed to MAG_APER and MAG_APER_ERR to better
  reflect the constant-aperture mode. Same for FLUX_CI and FLUXERR_CI
* The images are now explicitly checked for valid WCS keywords in the header
* Original fits files are no longer edited to fix their headers. Instead, a temporary copy is created. The FIX_HEADER keyword is removed from the settings.
* Specifying the RA, DEC, OBJECT keywords is no longer required
* Included a check on the SCAMP flag 64 in the linear motion filter
* The SkyBoT output CSV file has been moved to the cats subdirectory
* Progressbar for SkyBoT queries
* SKYBOT_NUMER is now NaN instead of '-' for known but unnumbered objects
* Renamed the inspect module to fix clash with astropy naming
* A change in the pandas API requires an up-to-date tqdm version. This is now enforced upon installation

1.2.5
---
* Including preprocessing steps: Certain FITS header keywords stop SCAMP from computing the astrometric solution. If FIX_HEADER is set to True, these keywords are removed from the original images. Further, the projection parameters CTYPE are changed from ZPN to TAN if necessary
* Started switching to f-strings. This requires python3.6 but improves readability and maintainability of the code
* Improved console output: The progress bar on the SExtractor runs and others now display time estimates. The tqdm package is used and added as requirement
* Some changes to the default settings of ssos and scamp
* Bugfixes

1.2.4
---
* Bugfix in fixed aperture extraction method

1.2.3
---
* Inspection mode added: using `ssos -i|--inspect path/to/analysis`, SSO candidates can quickly be visually inspected and quickly classified into SSO / Unknown / Artifact using the arrow keys
* FOV_DIMENSIONS can now be set automatically by pipeline
* The DATE-OBS keyword can now be passed in either ISOT or MJD format
* edited the GREETING to point to correct documentation
* no longer creating target directory if the images cannot be found
* Fixed a bug in the SWarp cutout creation where it would chose the wrong image extension if SCI_EXTENSION is 0
* Fixed the cutout images filename scheme so that they are now correctly ordered by epoch when calling from the command line
* Revisited the SkyBoT query: It is now executed at the beginning of the pipeline and states the amount of all known SSOs in the image. A brief overview is printed to the console.

1.2.2
---
* default.ssos is now properly included in the pip install

1.2.1
---
* SCAMP does not properly compute the proper motion of sources without a reference source association when choosing INCLUDE_ASTREFCAT to false. It is now always set to true while the bug is being investigated
* SExtractor catalogue header files are not adjusted anymore when SCAMP has not been run since the last time they were changed
* Excluded the HYGCAT from the package, it can be retrieved from http://www.astronexus.com/hyg

1.2.0
---
* Included the option to remove source detections within 1" of the reference catalogue sources in SCAMP before the pattern matching. This is turned on using the REMOVE_REF_SOURCES parameter. Random associations of SSOs with stars and galaxies are effectively removed this way. Note that the importance of the choice of reference catalogue increases.
* The pre-configured SExtractor and SCAMP config files were updated to the latest versions (2.25.0 and 2.7.7 respectively)
* Renamed several output parameters to better match common standards
* Code restructured, leading to major speed ups in SExtractor catalogue look-ups


1.1.10
---
* The SCAMP reference catalogue can now be used in the FILTER_STAR_REGIONS step, with an optional limit on the magnitude of the reference sources. Consequently, the FILTER_STAR_REGIONS step is renamed to FILTER_BRIGHT_SOURCES
* SSOs can exhibit constant apparent motion in declination. This scenario is now accounted for in the linear motion routine by transforming the equatorial to ecliptic coordinates and repeating the weighted linear fits in ecliptic longitude and latitude space
* Changed linear filter routine from scipy.optimize.curve_fit to statsmodels.api.WLS
* Changed the proper motion limits from exclusive to inclusive
* pipeline_settings.ssos is now default.ssos, analogous to astrOmatic software approach
